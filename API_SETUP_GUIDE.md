## ðŸ“¸ **Customizing the Developer Image**

The developer section currently shows placeholder initials "FQ". To add the actual developer photo:

1. **Save your image** as `static/images/developer.jpg`
2. **Recommended specs**: 400x400px, square format, professional headshot
3. **The image will automatically** replace the placeholder initials
4. **Make sure** the image is optimized for web (under 500KB recommended)

The placeholder will automatically switch to show your actual photo once the image file is added!
